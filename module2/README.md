# Module 2: Core Objects, Variables, Input and Output
In this code sample, we take our simple file parsing example a step further.

First, we start with a simulated data set that we create in `make_dataset.py`.

We use [Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker) to create fake names, addesses, social security numbers, and birthdates. We use `random` to create some random numbers.

The file created by `make_dataset.py` is a text file which will have to be parsed using string slicing and casting.

## Core concepts
* Writing and reading data to and from files
* Slicing strings
* Naming identifiers
* Mutable/Immutable
* Simulating data: working with random and Faker
